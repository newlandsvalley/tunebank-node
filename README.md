# Tunebank-node

An experimental rewrite of the [musicrest](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/musicrest) web service in Purescript on node. The backend is `Postgres` and the web server framework is `HTTPurple`.


## URL Scheme

The RESTful [URL Scheme](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/Tunebank-node/blob/master/URL-SCHEME.md) is somewhat simplified from that of `musicrest`. The main differences between the two are summarised [here](ttps://github.com/newlandsvalley/Tunebank-node/blob/master/DIFFERENCES.md).
